# Kantuta

Kantuta is the name of a bolivian products e-commerce web-app project.

## General idea

The main idea is to open the first bolivian-product e-commerce platform in Europe (and de facto the first one in Valencia, Spain).
Items are among thoose four categories a) leather, b) clothes, c) perfumes, d) artcraft.

## Tech Stack

* Backend: Node.js w/ Express.js
* Frontend: Vue.js w/ Pinia
* Database: MongoDB (maybe migrate to MySQL later)

The backend API is currently running on Heroku. The frontend on GitHub Pages.

## User Experience

Visitor lands on the homepage, he can navigate inside the website. He cand find items filtered by categories.
If interested in one o many items he can select it and add to his shopping cart.
If everything is fine he can proceed to the payment process (this specific payment function will be add later on).

## Updates

I'll update this README along with the Kantuta project progress.

## Important

After finishing Kantuta website I'll start the mobile app version of it.
ALSO I am planning to duplicate the concept of selling Bolivian products online to other latin american countries,
but under another "colorful" name project. Thoose will be:
"Goiaba" for Brazilian products
"Mate" for Argentinan products
"Canela" for Ecuadorian products
"Mango for " Colombian products

And also for local Valencian Community (Spain) region products
"Horchata" for Valencian products

## Starting

Starting locally in Valencia at first. If successful going national. If successful expanding to Europe.
